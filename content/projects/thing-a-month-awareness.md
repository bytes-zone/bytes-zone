The second [thing-a-month](@/projects/thing-a-month.md) project is a "random time tracker" I'm calling tinyping.

It works a bit like [TagTime](https://doc.beeminder.com/tagtime) and is good for getting a better awareness of moods and how I (and others) spend our time.

There are two big challenges here for me:

1. Understanding enough of the statistics to get useful results.
   I think I've already go an OK understanding, but this will test that assumption.
   However, it looks like the underlying math is actually fairly simple! ([1](@/micro/thing-a-month-03-01.md), [2](@/micro/thing-a-month-03-02.md))
2. Building something that can ask for discreet updates in enough places to be useful.
   This probably means making a native app of some kind eventually to use the right notifications APIs.

I started this in March and [continued into April](@/micro/thing-a-month-04-01.md) with the goal of getting something usable by the end of the month.
That didn't quite happen, and I dropped thing-a-month at the end of that month.
Tinyping lives on in some capacity, but not as a thing-a-month project.
