It's March, and time for the second [thing-a-month](@/projects/thing-a-month.md) project.

This month, I'll be exploring writing something like [TagTime](https://doc.beeminder.com/tagtime) that I (and others) can use for better awareness of moods and how we spend our time.

There are two big challenges here for me:

1. Understanding enough of the statistics to get useful results.
   I think I've already go an OK understanding, but this will test that assumption.
2. Building something that can ask for discreet updates in enough places to be useful.
   This probably means making a native app of some kind to use the right notifications APIs.

Of course, part of the challenge here is to keep things as small and simple as possible, so we'll see how much work is actually necessary!
