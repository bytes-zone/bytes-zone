In Septempber 2024, I started at [PayNearMe](https://paynearme.com) as a platform engineer. I wrote some early thoughts during the interview process in [what is platform engineering?](@/posts/what-is-platform-engineering.md) and refined them in [platform engineers work on the meta-product](@/posts/platform-engineers-work-on-the-meta-product.md).
