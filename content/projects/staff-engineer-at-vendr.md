In late October 2023, I started working at [Vendr](https://vendr.com) as a staff design systems engineer.
In that role, I work with both the design and engineering teams at Vendr to make making a consistent user experience easier.

I've notched some notable performance wins at Vendr!
For example, I reduced our first contentful paint metric by about 2 seconds in the first quarter of 2024, which brought largest contentful paint down as well.
