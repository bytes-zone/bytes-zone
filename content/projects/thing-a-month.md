I'm interested in making new products, and I've got a bunch of ideas.
So in 2024 (or at least the early part of it) I tried to make a thing a month!

The rules were pretty simple:

1. It had to be a "real" thing. Something you can buy, download, subscribe to, etc.
2. It had to be ready in a month.

If I decided I want one of the "things" to be improvements to an earlier thing, that would've been fine.
Point was: they couldn't be huge years-long projects.

Here are the projects I did:

- February 2024 (month 0): [setting the stage for the rest of the project with infra improvements](@/projects/thing-a-month-meta.md)
- March+April 2024 (months 1 and 2): [awareness through random time tracking](@/projects/thing-a-month-awareness.md)
- April (as part of a yak shave): [elm-duet](@/projects/elm-duet.md)

I ended up having to stop doing thing-a-month because the time constraint was infeasible for the things I was interested in building. I wrote about that at [stopping thing-a-month](@/micro/stopping-thing-a-month.md).
