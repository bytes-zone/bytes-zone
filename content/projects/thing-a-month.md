I'm interested in making new products, and I've got a bunch of ideas for doing it.
So in 2024 (or at least the early part of it) I'll be trying to make a thing a month!

The rules are pretty simple:

1. It has to be a "real" thing. Something you can buy, download, subscribe to, etc.
2. It has to be ready in a month.

If I decide I want one of the "things" to be improvements to an earlier things, that's fine.
Point is: they can't be huge years-long projects.

Thing-a-month projects:

- February 2024 (month 0): [setting the stage for the rest of the project with infra improvements](@/projects/thing-a-month-meta.md)
- March+April 2024 (months 1 and 2): [awareness through random time tracking](@/projects/thing-a-month-awareness.md)
