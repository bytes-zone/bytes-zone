After being an senior-ish software engineer and a team lead (like a tech lead elsewhere) for five years, I've been working as the first "wandering toolmaker" at [NoRedInk](https://noredink.com).
In this role, I'm spending about half of my time working on the product (mostly focused on improving life for <abbr title="English Language Arts">ELA</abbr> teachers and their students) and the remainder working on improving tooling and developer experience for the department and company.

So far, I've:

- added [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/) to our Rails monolith and got almost all (over 95%) of our code to `typed: true` levels of checking.
- created tools to help our accessibility team educate the company how to make our site more accessible
- explored alternate build tools like [rbt](@/projects/rbt.md)

I'm currently in the process of converting our JavaScript code (the stuff that we use to start our [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) apps) to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and working on [bold](@/projects/bold.md).
