After being an senior-ish software engineer and a team lead (like a tech lead elsewhere) for five years, I was the first "wandering toolmaker" at [NoRedInk](https://noredink.com).
In this role, I spent about half of my time working on the product (mostly focused on improving life for <abbr title="English Language Arts">ELA</abbr> teachers and their students) and the remainder working on improving tooling and developer experience for the department and company.

This included projects like:

- adding [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/) to our Rails monolith and getting almost all (over 95%) of our code to `typed: true` levels of checking.
- converting all our CoffeeScript code to JavaScript, then to TypeScript, and integrating it with the port-based FFI in Elm.
- creating tools to help our accessibility team educate the company how to make our site more accessible
- exploring alternate build tools like [rbt](@/projects/rbt.md)
