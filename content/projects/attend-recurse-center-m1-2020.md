In January of 2020, I attended one of the last in-person batches of [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in Brooklyn, New York.
I worked on an implemenation of the [Wave Function Collapse algorithm](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) (the game thing, not the quantum thing) in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

I'd recommend attending the Recurse Center to anyone!
The facilitators have built a really great community around [some well-thought-out shared values](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules).
I only had time for a mini batch (1 week), but I'd like to go back for a full 6– or 12–week session!
