From early June 2021 to December 2022, I've been working off and on on a tool called rbt (the Roc Build Tool.)
[All the work is open source](https://github.com/roc-lang/rbt).

I learned a lot from building rbt!
Enough, anyway, to know that to get the things I wanted out of a build system I'd need a different approach.
Long story short, that's why I started working on [bold](@/projects/bold.md).
