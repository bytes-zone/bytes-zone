While building tinyping, I had a lot of trouble syncing complex types between Elm and TypeScript, so I started building elm-duet.
It takes a [JSON Type Definition](https://jsontypedef.com/) schema and generates both Elm and TypeScript type definitions so the system can be type-checked end-to-end.

elm-duet isn't currently available anywhere, but I'm working on it!
