Around October 2023, I started growing hydroponic lettuce in my basement.
I first documented my setup at [Kratky in the basement](@/posts/kratky-in-the-basement.md), but quickly switched to a four-bucket system since 25 gallons of water was far too heavy.

As of December 2024, the system is currently dormant. I plan to restart grows in early 2025.
