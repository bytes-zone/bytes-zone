Tinyping is a tool to help people (myself included) to make sure they're using their time in accordance with their values.

It does this by random sampling: every so often, it will ask you what you're working on.
Once it has enough pings, you can use statistics to build up an accurate picture of how you're using your time!

Tinyping is currently under development and hasn't been released yet; there's a placeholder page at [tinyping.net](https://tinyping.net).

This project started out as [the last thing-a-month](@/projects/thing-a-month-awareness.md), and was inspired by [TagTime](https://doc.beeminder.com/tagtime).
