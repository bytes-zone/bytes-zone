I've been an on-and-off user of [Alloy](https://alloytools.org/) for several years now, but after switching teams at [NoRedInk](https://noredink.com) I decided to start modeling all our new projects in it and teaching my colleagues how to as well.
This has been really interesting work!
Modeling with Alloy has frequently meant finding out about edge cases in our thinking (or in some cases, finding out we were totally wrong.)
