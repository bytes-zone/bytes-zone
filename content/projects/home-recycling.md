I've been interested both in environmentalism and in making things for a long time, but hadn't realized until the summer of 2021 that I could combine those into something interesting!
Inspired by [The Brothers Make](https://www.brothersmake.com/) and [Precious Plastic](https://preciousplastic.com/), I've started saving all the #2 plastic that we use at home—milk jugs, shampoo and detergent bottles, etc—and melting it down as a raw material to make new things.
I'm still beginning to figure this out (I have more plastic stored than melted) but I'm excited by the possibilities!
