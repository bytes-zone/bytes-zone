I'm working on a book about writing local-first software. Instead of doing a survey of all the libraries available, I'm taking a first principles approach. That means doing a lot of explaining CRDTs, syncing, and the like, but I'm having a ton of fun with it so far.

As of mid-January 2025, I have the introduction and first chapter done, and I'm working on the implementation that will end up being built up throughout the book. This currently looks like a TUI that I am already using to see how the user experience is!

I hope to be at the place where beta readers can look at the book in early 2025!
