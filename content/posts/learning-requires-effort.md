I recently finished [*How to Take Smart Notes*](https://takesmartnotes.com).
The core idea I took away from the book is that *learning requires effort*.

## Learning by Doing

I think people generally recognize that learning requires effort, but have an easier time applying that to physical activities than mental ones.
You don't really go around assuming that Olympic athletes are just people who jumped out of bed the morning of the games and decided to win gold in ice dancing.
Instead, we recognize that athletes train for years, prioritizing their sport above many other aspects in their life, in order to reach the top of the field.

But when it comes to learning in more abstract ways, it's easy to forget that effort is necessary!
For example, I've made the mistake many times of assuming that learning has occurred just because I reached the last page of a book.
The Zettelkasten method ([covered](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) [many](https://www.fastcompany.com/90535318/this-simple-but-powerful-analog-method-will-rocket-your-productivity) [places](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125)) is one way to avoid this, and the one that *How to Take Smart Notes* recommends.
In this method, "effort" looks like making notes by rephrasing and making connections to things you already know.

But outside of note-taking, I also recognize this in how programmers learn new tools and techniques.
When someone says they want to learn, a common response goes "well, make a small but useful project and see what you learn."
I've even told people that many times, without recognizing that I'm telling people to learn through effort.

So "learning requires effort" seems pretty general to me: it applies both in places I expected and places I didn't.
That's a useful principle, and now I can use it to judge if I'm learning or not: am I putting in effort?
If not, I'm probably not learning!

## Technology Can't Learn For You

"Learning requires effort" also means that technology can't learn for you.

That's another mistake I've made many times over the years!
It's natural for me to try and find the perfect tool, when what I actually need to just get into the work of effortful learning as quickly as I can.

That isn't to say that technology can't help, but it can only be a force-multiplier at best.
If your effort is zero, it won't make any difference!

## Put It All Together

So, if learning requires effort, how can we make ourselves learn?
Simple: you've just got to put in the effort.
But, not so simple: what effort is the right for you and for what you're learning?

If you just thrash and flail, by trying things that are way beyond your current skill or level of understanding, you won't actually learn much.
To be effective, the things you're trying to learn have to be just beyond what you can do already (in the [zone of proximal development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development).)

That's what a good teacher, mentor, or coach is for: someone who has been where you are, or helped other people learn the thing you're trying to learn, can give you good advice on the best places to apply your effort.
