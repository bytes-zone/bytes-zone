I recently finished [*How to Take Smart Notes*](https://takesmartnotes.com) (quick review: engaging take on a dry subject. the sample on the website is brief and independently valuable. Go read it.)

The core thing I took away from the book is that *learning requires effort*.

## Learning by Doing

In Ahren's world, this means something fairly abstract and idea-driven: he puts in effort by rephrasing and making connections to things he already knows.
But I think we recognize effort easier in physical forms!
Nobody goes around thinking that Olympic athletes are just people who jumped out of bed one day and decided to win gold in ice dancing.
We recognize that athletes train for years, prioritizing that above many other aspects in their life, in order to reach the top of their sports.

But when it comes to ideas, it's somehow easy to assume that learning has occurred just because you reach the last page of a book.
It's a weird disconnect, and I've fallen for it many times!
The Zettelkasten method ([covered](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) [basically](https://www.fastcompany.com/90535318/this-simple-but-powerful-analog-method-will-rocket-your-productivity) [everywhere](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125)) is one way out of this, and the one that *How to Take Smart Notes* recommends.

I also recognize this in how programmers usually learn.
When someone says they want to learn a new language, it's super common for someone to respond "well, make a small but useful project and see what you learn."
I've even told people that many times, without recognizing that I'm telling people to learn through effort.

But!
It's important to note that "effort" doesn't mean "thrash and flail until you succeed."
The things you're trying to learn have to be just beyond what you can do already (in the [zone of proximal development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development).)

## Technology Can't Learn For You

"Learning requires effort" also means that technology can't learn for you.

That's another mistake I've made many times over the years!
It's super easy for me to try and find the perfect tool, when what I actually need to just get to the work of learning as quickly as I can.

That isn't to say that technology can't help, but it can only be a force-multiplier.
And if your effort is zero, a multiplier won't make any difference!

## Put It All Together

So, if learning requires effort, how can we make ourselves learn?
Simple: you've just got to put in the effort.
But, not so simple: what effort is the right for you and for what you're learning?

That's what a good teacher, mentor, or coach is for: someone who has been where you are, or helped other people learn the thing you're trying to learn, can give you good advice on the best places to apply your effort.
