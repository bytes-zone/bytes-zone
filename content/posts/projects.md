Just a little note: inspired by [/now pages](https://sive.rs/nowff), I've put a bunch of current and past projects up on the home page at [bytes.zone](https://bytes.zone), listed by date at [bytes.zone/projects](@/projects/_index.md).
I'll update them occasionally, adding blog posts for RSS readers as relevant.

If you're interested in what I've been up to lately, there it is!
