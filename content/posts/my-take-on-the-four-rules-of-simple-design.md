I've been thinking about how to write better tests recently, and I happened on Kent Beck's four rules for simple design.
In a nutshell, these rules were meant to give objective criteria for the question "is this code simple?"
The original formulation goes like this: a piece of code can be said to be simple if it...

> 1. Runs all the tests.
> 2. Has no duplicated logic. Be wary of hidden duplication like parallel class hierarchies
> 3. States every intention important to the programmer.
> 4. Has the fewest possible classes and methods.

In practice, I really like that while the intention may have been to make an objective metric for simplicity, people tend to treat these rules as *imperfect but useful*.
That is, they give us a way to judge if a piece of code is better or worse than another one.
This turns out to be a helpful way of judging internal quality of a piece of software&mdash;and improving that is why we write tests and refactor code in the first place!

I think this usefulness has made these rules surprisingly uncontroversial (at least to me, based on how much I know we programmers like bikeshedding!)
The most controversial topic, in fact, seems to be which order to apply rules 2 and 3 in.

In reading about this, I collected a bunch of interpretations of the four rules from various authors:

| Rule | [Kent Beck][kb]                                     | [Martin Fowler][mf] | [J.B. Rainsberger][jbr] | [Corey Haines][ch]   |
|------|:----------------------------------------------------|:--------------------|:------------------------|:---------------------|
| 1.   | Runs all the tests.                                 | Passes the tests    | Passes its tests        | Tests Pass           |
| 2.   | Has no duplicated logic. [&hellip;]                 | No duplication      | Minimizes Duplication   | No Duplication (DRY) |
| 3.   | States every intention important to the programmer. | Reveals intention   | Maximizes clarity       | Expresses Intent     |
| 4.   | Has the fewest possible classes and methods.        | Fewest elements     | Has fewer elements      | Small                |

(n.b. I switched rules 2 and 3 in Fowler's and Haines' formulations for reading consistency.
Based on these author's writings, I think it's fine in this context.)

I have enjoyed applying these rules to my own code, but in the spirit of "what I cannot create, I do not understand," I thought it'd be fun to try and make my own formulation.
In doing this, I'd like to avoid simply paraphrasing the four rules&mdash;I want to be able to explain what makes code simple to someone who has never heard of this concept.
That means being able to make a reasonable argument for each point, as well as talking about the consequences of leaving them off.

I originally thought that'd be one post, but then I did a bunch of research to make sure I wasn't just making stuff up and it turned out super long.
So here's what we're going to do: over the next month, I'll be publishing one post per week about a new rule.
When I do that, I'll come back to this post and link them up.
