In the beginning of February, I spent a lot of time working on a new library for parsing CSV data in Elm.
(Basically, the existing libraries did not have `andThen` and I needed it!)

The resulting library turned out quite nice, I think, and in addition it's very fast!
I gave talk to the Elm London user group about it, which you can see at [elm-csv: be as boring—and as fast—as possible](@/talks/elm-csv-be-as-boring-and-as-fast-as-possible.md).

If you'd just like to see the code, it lives at [github.com/BrianHicks/elm-csv](https://github.com/BrianHicks/elm-csv).
