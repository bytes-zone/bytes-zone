Just a short post to note that I've added a [colophon](@/colophon.md) to this site.
It goes over how to get the source of this site (git), what I track (not much, and no third-party stuff), and how the page is designed to last.

I admit it's pretty self-indulgent, but I wanted to be public about some of the things I've been thinking about while building this site.
Please feel free to [email me](mailto:brian@brianthicks.com) any questions or comments about it!
I'd love to make it as clear as possible.

To repeat the link, that's [the colophon page](@/colophon.md), and linked to from the footer.
Check it out!
