I love hearing from people and talking shop, so like [other](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/) [nice](https://hillelwayne.com/open-invite/) people on the internet, I extend an invitation to you: [email me about whatever](mailto:brian@brianthicks.com)!
Some things I'd love to talk about, or hear about:

- frontend development
- things technologists can do to help with big problems, especially the climate crisis.
- community organization, especially (in non-pandemic times) meetups and conferences.
- neat papers and essays

I'd also be happy to answer questions about any of that, or anything I've written in general.
But please don't feel like you have to offer me something just to ask a question&mdash;I just love getting emails from people!
[Hit send](mailto:brian@brianthicks.com)!

Once it's safe to do so, I'd also love to meet in person if you're in the St. Louis area.
