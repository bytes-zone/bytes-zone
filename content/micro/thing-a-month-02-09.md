Well, it's March 4 already, so it's about time to wrap up the first month with a short post. What'd I get done this month? Well:

- I have a Kubernetes cluster ready to run all the workloads from my other experiments.
- That cluster is running my blog and associated services, plus some other smaller sites.
- I've got deployments all automated and ready to go.

<!-- more -->

There is some work left undone, though, of course:

- The cluster isn't very well hardened yet. I'm pretty close there, though: I really only need to set up an alerting system for policy violations and security events and it'll be done.
- I'm still running [git.bytes.zone](https://git.bytes.zone) on the old infrastructure. I'm giving the few folks who are still using it some time to move their repos off.

Overall, I feel pretty good about this. I've learned a lot and I have something nice to show for it! On to next month!
