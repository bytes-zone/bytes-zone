I'm going to try starting to make a thing a month. ([Here's the projects entry](@/projects/thing-a-month.md))

The long (looooong) term goal is financial independence, but the short-term goal is more about exercising my creative muscles, having something cool to write about, and actually trying to make the things I've been dreaming of.

This first month is a meta-month. I know for the rest of the months I do this project I'll want to be able to ship things as quickly as possible and not spend my precious time on infrastructure or setup, so I'm going to see about frontloading most of that this month.
