I'm currently in a "business hack and chat" meeting with some Recurse Center alumni! I'm gonna spend 45 minutes looking for people chatting about _improving_ with formal methods (instead of just using the term colloquially or publishing papers about their use.) My hit list: look around on subreddits, then look in some tool-specific forums to see if there are newbies there. I'm thinking Alloy and TLA+ to start, but maybe I'll find more around the edges.

(2 minutes in) OK, let's try [/r/formalmethods](https://www.reddit.com/r/formalmethods/) first. That seems broad. … Well, maybe overbroad. There appear to be only about 20 posts in the last year, and quite a few of them seem to be promotion-focused instead of asking questions. Some learning posts show up, though: [someone is interested in pursuing a PhD in formal methods](https://www.reddit.com/r/formalmethods/comments/wafwjn/interested_in_pursuing_a_phd_in_formal_methods/), [someone who is having trouble with a graduate program](https://www.reddit.com/r/formalmethods/comments/z6qa2c/help_i_cant_figure_out_a_formal_method_for_my/), [someone asking for review of an Alloy model](https://www.reddit.com/r/formalmethods/comments/w1zapf/review_of_model/) (but they're asking to ask, so there are no actual replies in the last year), [someone trying to find practitioners to interview](https://www.reddit.com/r/formalmethods/comments/viw53c/interviewing_formal_method_practitioner/), [someone who has made a "pragmatic guide to formal modeling"](https://www.reddit.com/r/formalmethods/comments/vhrw1u/pragmatic_formal_modeling/), and [someone wondering how to make FM more popular](https://www.reddit.com/r/formalmethods/comments/uuqg19/popularizing_formal_methods/). Most of these seem like OK threads to try and read to get a sense of people's struggles, but overall it doesn't seem like this is a place I could get involved in community—it's just too slow!

(10 minutes in) However, there was a link to [/r/systems_engineering](https://reddit.com/r/systems_engineering) that seems much larger and some of the posts use "formal" in a way that seems promising. But once I looked at it, it seems like this is a large-scale traditional engineering thing. Lots of ™s and ®s after the official pages of these products. There's definitely money there waiting to be spent, but it's not something that I have any particular skill or advantage in.

(15 minutes in) Looked at [/r/tlaplus](https://reddit.com/r/tlaplus) briefly. It wasn't super promising. Seems low-traffic again. Reddit asked me if the subreddit had profanity in its name. I said "no" and then it asked me if there's profanity in the posts. I mean, I don't know man… I don't _not_ swear when I'm using TLA+, great though it is.

(26 minutes in) It's probably about time to go look at tool-specific forums. I know about [the Alloy discourse](https://alloytools.discourse.group/), which is helpful but fairly slow-paced. I snagged some threads to read later there, though. There's also a [TLA+ Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/tlaplus). (Side note: TLA+ is probably the best-known formal methods tool in my circles, so I'd probably end up using a lot of it… is that where I want to take this business? I'm not sure I do!)

OK, 30 minutes in. Time for some OODA:

1. **Observe: what am I feeling, why, and what is my impulse?**
   - **What am I feeling?** I'm feeling discouraged and a little stressed.
   - **Why?** Discouraged because I can't find the kinds of things I'm looking for, stressed because OH NO this is the second time what if I can't EVER FIND ANYTHING???? Drama drama drama drama. (Only feeling this a little, fortunately.)
   - **What is my impulse?** Call this another "no" and switch audiences again.
1. **Orient:**
   - **What is happening?**
     - I spent 45 minutes or so finding not very much in the common locations, although I didn't look extensively on StackOverflow.
     - The folks I emailed say there's no big mass of FM folks hanging out online (except on LinkedIn, where folks have landed after Twitter.)
   - **What does the data say?** The kind of discussion I want to read and participate in doesn't exist, at least not in places that are accessible for me.
   - **What do I want?** I want a place to get a slightly easier foothold.
1. **Decide:** Sounds like it's time to broaden my search in one of a couple ways:
   - I could go back to Ruby, but focus on Ruby for itself now instead of Ruby for Sorbet's sake.
   - I could do the next item on [my possibilities list](@/micro/launchftw-003.md), which is something in frontend. Maybe CSS?
   - I could try and come up with more possibilities and analyze those.
1. **Act:** At the risk of overanalysis, I think I'm going to try and brainstorm a few more possibilities tomorrow.
