Just a quick note: I just made [elm-duet](https://github.com/BrianHicks/elm-duet) public and released v0.1.0.
If it sounded great to you based on [my post from the other day](@/micro/thing-a-month-04-02.md) then you can now get it!
(But if you remember that, it's also worth noting I improved those docs a lot!)
