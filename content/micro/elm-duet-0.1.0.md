Just a quick note: I just made [elm-duet](https://github.com/BrianHicks/elm-duet) public and released v0.1.0.
If it sounded great to you based on [my post from the other day](@/micro/thing-a-month-04-02.md) then you can now get it!
(But if you remember that, it's also worth noting I improved those docs a lot!)

_Hopefully_ this represents a stable release, but we'll see what we see when other people get their hands on it.
I'm certainly planning to work on tinyping with this as the base, so I'm sure there will be changes and an 0.2.0 down the road a ways.
