I've wanted to pick up an instrument again for a while now. I considered the guitar, but:

1. the strings hurt my fingers
2. they're so big!
3. when I've tried to learn, I've felt a lot of pressure to get good or get out. Rock star mentality, maybe? Not my speed, anyway.

So instead, I'm going to try the ukulele:

<!-- more -->

1. nylon strings
2. small and cute
3. all the stuff I have found about ukulele is like "yeah, we're all here to have fun." Really chill, which I appreciate.

And as a nice couple of bonuses:

1. I really like the sound of the ones I bought. I got two because:
2. My son wants to learn with me!

I'm really looking forward to messing around here and making some music!
