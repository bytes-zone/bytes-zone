OK, doing lesson 1 this morning.
"Three rules for success in your launch ftw challenge."
It starts off with Amy Hoy's story of launching a product business.
Key quote for me: "I resolved 'This time, I'll do what works'" after tons of "plan-crastination."
The daydreams certainly sound like me, although I worry about trying to see myself too much in other peoples' stories.

So the three most important rules:

> 1. DO learn what people need, want, and will actually buy, and make that
> 2. DO design a realistic plan quickly — for a tiny first product, with marketing baked in — so you can hit the ground running and start seeing traffic and sales as soon as possible
> 3. DO execute and ship things that are good enough, not perfect, and keep doing it until you build your way up into success

Summarizing in my own words: find something that people are willing to buy, make ONLY that (no overcomplicating things!) and ship it quickly to get feedback.
Reminds me of the way I try to push at work to ship something small and sharp so that we can get more data—why not apply that mindset to my own products as well?
