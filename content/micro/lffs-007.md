It's been a while since I've written anything here, especially about [Local-First from Scratch](@/projects/local-first-from-scratch.md). Here's what I've been up to:

<!-- more -->

- I took a little break (just a couple weeks) to learn about MiniZinc. Mainly I learned that it's a very opaque systemâ€¦ even getting a problem optimized enough to even be solved is challenging (at least at my skill level.)
- Signed up for [One Big Win](https://www.raptitude.com/2024/08/do-quests-not-goals/) as a framework for writing.
- During OBW (8 weeks), I did a lot of research to backfill the theoretical fundamentals of my writing work, as well as breaking ground on a new implementation.
- Since OBW, I've been continuing with the implementation.

At this point, I've got maybe 25% of the code I need to write an actually-decent version of the book. It's going slow-ish, so I'm trying to reserve some time to write. Hopefully I can start publishing more regularly here!
