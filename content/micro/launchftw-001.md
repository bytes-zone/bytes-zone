I'm kicking off my microposts (less-edited, ephemeral, subject to disappear at any time) by saying that I'm about to try out [launch ftw](https://stackingthebricks.com/launchftw/) again.
I tried this once before and bounced off of it because I didn't find an audience I felt I could commit to.
I'm trying it again because I watched a video of the instructors, Amy Hoy and Alex Hillman, and they talked a lot about the first step not necessarily being permanent or needing to be the best thing ever, but rather to just try and see where it goes.
That resonated with me, so I'm going to give it a go!
