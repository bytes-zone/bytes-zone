I think I may need to change up the outline for Local-First from Scratch. Originally, I had this idea that it would be cool to make two separate clients that used the same sync code and data structures to demonstrate a modeling-first approach. <!-- more --> Now that I'm in the thick of it, though, I'm realizing that I don't want to have to explain the incidental complexity of both a TUI and a GUI. One would be fine, but explaining how two separate event loops work might be a little much!
