I gave this talk twice.
The first was at Elm Europe.
I think this turned out better; I had prepared the talk expecting to fit into twenty minutes.

I also gave it at the first Olso Elm Day the following Saturday.
This talk slot was significantly longer.
I had a lot more graphs to show, but the talk didn't feel as tight to me.
If you want additional detail, this might be the one for you.
